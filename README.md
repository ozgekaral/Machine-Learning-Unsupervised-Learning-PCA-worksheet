# Unsupervised Machine Learning + PCA Worksheet

This repository will teach you about the following unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

## K-means Clustering
K-means clustering is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points together. It is used for identifying and classifying groups or clusters in a dataset based on their similarities and differences.

## Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is another unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group similar data points together. It is a clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters by either merging smaller clusters into larger ones or dividing larger clusters into smaller ones. This hierarchy of clusters can be visualized as a tree-like diagram, called a dendrogram.

## Principal Component Analysis
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. It is often used in data analysis and machine learning to identify patterns in high-dimensional data, which can be difficult to visualize or interpret.

It has many applications in various fields, including image processing, genetics, and finance. It is also commonly used as a preprocessing step for other machine learning algorithms, such as clustering and classification, to improve their performance by reducing the dimensionality of the input data.
